# ZAO Festivals - learnings + ideas log

A growing log from looping on ZAO Festivals. Each pass adds verified learnings + fresh ideas. Newest on top.

## Pass 7 - 2026-06-28 (ZAO Festivals as a protocol / chapter-anywhere)

"A festival as a protocol, not a product" is already the brand line - make it the growth engine. ZAOville
(DCoop ran the DMV chapter) is proof the model travels: someone other than the core team threw a ZAO-[name]
festival. Scale by enabling more hosts, not by ZAO running every event.

### The model
Anyone in a creative community can host a **ZAO-[their-city]** chapter. ZAO provides the brand + the kit + a
match fund; the host runs it locally; upside is shared (host-owners join the ownership tiers from pass 5).

### The chapter kit (mostly already exists in the zaostock repo)
- The naming system + the 1-page brand book (pass 3) - instant identity.
- The artist CRM (statuses, points, cypher), artist outreach templates, the artist rider, the deal-memo
  template (docs/music/) - the booking machine, ready to clone.
- The run-of-show / program pattern + the sponsor finders-fee structure (docs/) - ops + revenue.
- An Artizen fund/project template (the submission packets we built) - the crowdfunding rail.
- The site is forkable (zaostock.com is one Next.js app) - a host gets their own page fast.

### Brand guardrails (so the protocol stays "ZAO")
Keep: ZAO-[name] naming, navy + gold, free to attend, artists paid fairly, community-owned, no-jargon-locally.
A light "powered by ZAO Festivals" license, not a franchise contract. Trust + brand book over legal lift.

### Why it's the growth engine
- Each chapter = more artists, more cities, more brand equity, feeding the next chapter (a flywheel).
- ZAO becomes the protocol/standard for community-owned festivals, not just one festival - far bigger than
  ZAOstock alone, and on-mission (more community-owned culture in more places).
- Every chapter plugs into the same Artizen funnel + the ZAO Fund - the financial layer scales with it.

### Open / to learn
- How did ZAOville actually run under DCoop? (the real template in practice - ask Zaal/DCoop)
- What's the minimum kit a first-time host needs to not fail? (de-risk the protocol)

## Pass 6 - 2026-06-28 (content + growth engine)

The team has a documented social-media-owner gap. The fix is a simple, repeatable content engine - not more
effort, just a format that runs itself off footage already on hand.

### The repeatable formats (low-effort, high-frequency)
1. **"Moments" series** - one real event photo + a few sentences from Zaal (what it was / why it matters /
   the invite). This is BOTH the Artizen Artifact format AND a recurring social post. One asset, two jobs.
2. **Countdown** - "ZAOstock in X days" is already organic; make it a standing weekly post with a different
   photo each time. Free engagement hook.
3. **Artist spotlights** - one post per confirmed artist (feeds off the CRM as artists move to `confirmed`).
   Doubles as the lineup reveal, and each artist reshares to their fans = distribution.
4. **Build-in-public** - the prep, the team, the standup wins. The festival's making-of IS content.
5. **Lineage reels** - the ZAO-CHELLA/PALOOZA recap footage (the IG reels exist) recut as teasers.

### Two-track rule (already in the brand book)
- **Web3 track:** Artizen, the 3x match, the bloc - for the crypto crowd.
- **Local track:** free music, Oct 3, no jargon - for the 4,000 Ellsworth residents. Never cross the streams.

### Growth = turn every artist into a distribution node
- Each confirmed artist posts to their own fans -> their fans buy a $10 Artifact / hear about Oct 3. The lineup
  isn't just talent, it's the marketing channel. The artist-spotlight series operationalizes this.
- Cross-promote with the ZAO bloc (the other Artizen projects) - shared audience, shared drive.
- Ride Art of Ellsworth weekend's existing press + foot traffic instead of buying awareness.

### Cheapest win
A single recurring "Moments" post (photo + Zaal's lines), 2-3x a week, pulling from existing footage. It feeds
the feed, the Artizen page, and the countdown at once - and needs no designer, just a photo and three sentences.

## Pass 5 - 2026-06-28 (the ownership model, deepened)

The differentiator: make "the crowd that funds it owns it" REAL, but light - a contributors' circle, not a legal
coop (formalize later, maybe via the Colorado A-Corp vehicle the ZAO is already tracking). It runs on systems
ZAO already has: the artist CRM (`volunteer_eligible`, `points_earned`, `cypher_role`) + ZOLs (ZAO contribution
credits) + the fractal/Respect governance lineage.

### Three contributor classes (who "owns" a piece)
1. **Artist-owners** - anyone who plays or creates for a chapter. Standing = a slot in the run-of-show say + a
   recap reel + a profile + priority for the next chapter.
2. **Crew-owners** - volunteers/team. Standing earned through hours -> the CRM's `points_earned` already does
   this. Points unlock a vote in lineup/ops decisions + recognition + ZOLs.
3. **Backer-owners** - anyone who funds it (Artizen Artifacts, donations). Standing = name on the supporters
   wall + the build-in-public updates + a say in one open decision per chapter (e.g. a community-pick slot).

### How it works (light v1, no legal lift)
- Points/ZOLs are the shared currency of standing across all three classes (already half-built in the CRM).
- One **community-pick decision per chapter** (a lineup slot, the closing act, the charity) voted by everyone
  with standing - the smallest real "ownership" that's true, not theater.
- A public **contributors' wall** (artists + crew + backers together) - the festival's people ARE the brand.
- Recognition compounds: standing carries to the next ZAO-[chapter], so the circle grows festival to festival.

### Why it's a moat
No corporate festival can copy "the people who built and funded it own it + decide it." It turns attendees into
owners, makes the 4,000-resident awareness goal a recruitment funnel into the circle, and gives every Artizen
backer a reason beyond charity (you get a say). Ties straight to ZAO's existing Respect/fractal DNA.

### Open / to learn
- PALOOZA/CHELLA poster designs (brand history) - NOT web-indexed; needs Zaal's actual files/screens. Gap.
- Does the cypher feed the ownership model (cypher participants = artist-owners)?
- Whether to map standing to ZOLs 1:1 or keep festival points separate.

## Pass 4 - 2026-06-28 (community-owned models + roster)

### Learnings
- **zaostock.com/artists = the VISUAL-artist recruitment page** ("we are taking interest"), not the music
  lineup. Music lineup is a separate surface (/musicians). The artist data is DB-backed but the public split is
  visual vs music. (Zaal had earlier considered pulling the visual-artists page - it's still live.)
- **Community-owned festival/coop models (verified):** cooperative ownership uses CLASSES - artist-owners,
  worker-owners who earn lifelong membership through hours of service, each with elected board seats. The
  guiding principle is **"with, not for"** - the platform is defined by its users, self-determination built in.
  Free/DIY festivals run on negotiated venue deals + donations + **community crowdfunding** (validates the
  Artizen play exactly). Peer references: Subvert.fm (collectively-owned music marketplace), Artisans
  Cooperative (artist-owned Etsy alternative).

### Ideas
1. **"With, not for" as the brand principle** - sharper and more ownable than "community-owned." A festival
   built WITH artists and the crowd, not FOR them.
2. **Make "the crowd that funds it owns it" real with light ownership tiers:** artist-owners, crew-owners
   (volunteer hours -> standing), backer-owners. The artist CRM already has `volunteer_eligible` + `points_earned`
   - that is the SEED of worker-ownership. Formalize it even informally (a contributors' board, a say in the
   lineup, ZOLs-style credits).
3. **The Artizen crowdfund = the textbook "community crowdfunding a DIY festival"** - frame it that way to the
   web3 crowd; it's a proven model, not a novelty.
4. **Cite the peers** (Subvert, Artisans Coop) when pitching ZAO Festivals as artist-owned - shows it's a real
   movement, not a one-off.
5. **Resolve the /artists vs /musicians split** - one clear "artists" brand surface (music + visual), or clearly
   labeled lanes, so the brand reads cleanly.

## Pass 3 - 2026-06-28 (brand book shipped)

- Drafted the 1-page brand book -> `research/zaofestivals-brand-book.md` (naming system, palette, visual
  language, two-register voice, logo to-build, do/don't). Closes the "no documented system" gap.
- Still to learn: PALOOZA/CHELLA poster designs (brand history - need the actual files/screens), an existing
  ZAO Festivals logo if any, comparable COMMUNITY-OWNED festival brands (not the Coachella tier) as closer
  models, and the live artist roster (zaostock.com/artists, DB-gated).

## Pass 2 - 2026-06-28 (brand)

### Learnings
- **Current @zaofestivals voice:** casual + web3-native hype. "zm" is the house greeting (their "gm"),
  countdown-driven ("ZAO-STOCK in 195 days"), community-rallying ("Who's ready for the next ZAO-Festival??"),
  heavy on Spaces + RTs. The voice = hype, countdown, community-first.
- **Festival-brand principles (verified):** (1) a documented design SYSTEM - typography + primary/secondary
  colors + custom iconography + photo guidelines, in a brand book; (2) a MODULAR logo - a primary wordmark +
  a simple emblem that works tiny (avatar) to huge (stage scrim); (3) Instagram-worthy on-site moments are
  free branding (Coachella installations); (4) consistent storytelling recognizable at a glance.

### The ZAO Festivals brand, as it stands (read)
- **Signature device: the "ZAO-[pun]" naming system** - ZAO-PALOOZA, ZAO-CHELLA, ZAOville, ZAOstock. This is
  the strongest, most ownable brand asset already in hand. Lean all the way in: every chapter = ZAO + a
  festival name. Instantly recognizable, infinitely extensible.
- **Emerging visual language: navy #0a1628 + gold #f5a623, crowd silhouettes, stage light, hands up.** The
  106-agent Artifact pass converged on exactly this (the "Crowd Light Surge" aesthetic) - that IS the look.
- **Voice: "zm", countdown, community-first, hype** online - but LOCALLY (Ellsworth) flip to lead-with-music,
  zero-jargon. Two registers, same brand.

### Brand-building plan (ideas)
1. **Write a 1-page ZAO Festivals brand book:** the ZAO-[pun] naming rule, navy+gold palette, the silhouette/
   gold-light photo style, the "zm" voice + the local no-jargon register. One page so the 27-person team stays
   consistent. (Biggest gap - no documented system exists.)
2. **A modular mark:** a primary "ZAO Festivals" wordmark + a small emblem (works as an X avatar AND an Artifact
   corner). The naming is verbal equity; give it a visual anchor.
3. **A signature on-site moment at ZAOstock** - one Instagram installation (a gold-light arch, a WaveWarZ
   screen) people photograph = free branding toward the 4,000-resident goal.
4. **Codify "zm"** as the community ritual/greeting - small, but it's already organic; own it.
5. **Treat past posters (PALOOZA/CHELLA) as brand artifacts** - collect them; the lineage is brand equity.
6. **Consistent Artifact aesthetic across all ZAO projects** = a recognizable "ZAO on Artizen" look (navy/gold
   silhouettes) so the whole bloc reads as one family on the platform.

### To learn next (brand)
- Is there an existing ZAO Festivals logo/mark? (check zaostock.com assets)
- The PALOOZA/CHELLA poster designs (brand history).
- More of the voice (full post history via scraper).
- Comparable COMMUNITY-OWNED festival brands (not just Coachella) - closer models.

## Pass 1 - 2026-06-28

### Learnings (from the zaostock repo)
- **Artist pipeline is a real Supabase CRM.** Statuses: wishlist -> contacted -> interested -> confirmed ->
  travel_booked (+ declined). Plus a "cypher" feature (cypher_interested / cypher_role), artist points, and
  volunteer eligibility. The confirmed lineup lives in the DB (not in the repo).
- **The Grand is directly across the street from the Franklin Street Parklet** (the ZAOstock venue). Soul
  Benders played a Food-for-Health benefit there May 24; Zaal plugged in to build local relationships. It's a
  natural indoor stage / afterparty / co-programming partner.
- **Awareness goal: 4,000 of Ellsworth's ~8,000 residents** before Oct 3, via local relationships not ads.
  Local framing rule: lead with music, zero jargon, never mention web3/crypto to the Ellsworth crowd.
- The team has artist outreach templates, an artist rider, and a deal-memo template (docs/music/).

### Ideas (fresh)
1. **"Bring artists to the stage" maps 1:1 to the `travel_booked` pipeline.** The ZAO Festivals Artizen project
   should literally fund the travel line - "your $10 helps fly an artist to the stage." Concrete, honest, ties
   the ask to a real CRM stage.
2. **A ZAOstock Cypher** (the cypher feature) = recurring content + an Artifact source. Film a cypher, loop it,
   that's a moving Artifact + a teaser reel.
3. **The Grand co-programming** - an indoor afterparty / second stage across the street. Doubles the day, gives
   sponsors an indoor option, and deepens the local relationship.
4. **Two-audience Artizen split.** The crypto crowd backs via Artizen; the Ellsworth crowd never sees crypto -
   they get "free music festival Oct 3." Keep the two funnels separate (the site already does this).
5. **Per-artist Artifacts.** Each confirmed artist mints their own $10 Artifact (their face/sound) - they sell to
   their fans, the ZAO Fund matches. Turns every artist into a fundraiser + gives the festival a roster of
   Artifacts.
6. **Document every local show** (Soul Benders pattern) - the social-media-owner gap. Each local gig = content +
   3 new local relationships toward the 4,000 goal.
7. **Heart of Ellsworth weekend co-promo** - ZAOstock is part of Art of Ellsworth (Oct 2-5); ride the town's
   existing press + foot traffic instead of buying awareness.

### To learn next
- The actual confirmed artist count + names (DB-gated - need Zaal or a zaostock.com/artists read).
- What the "cypher" actually is (a rap cypher? a collab track?).
- The latest @zaofestivals / @bettercallzaal posts (scraper available).
- The run-of-show / program for Oct 3.
