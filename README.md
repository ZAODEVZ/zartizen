# ZArtizen

The ZAO's home for everything Artizen: how The ZAO operates inside the Artizen ecosystem as a
fund manager, a creator, and a community - plus the research, the playbooks, and the ready-to-use
kit to execute.

Graduated out of the ZAOOS monorepo (2026-06-13) into its own repo under ZADEVZ so the work stops
colliding with parallel sessions and stands on its own. Research provenance still lives in ZAOOS
(PR #844); this repo is the operating home.

## What Artizen is (60 seconds)

Web3 match-funding platform for art / science / tech / culture, founded by René Pinnell. Creators
mint $10 open-edition "Artifact" NFTs (100% to creator, 0% platform fee, Ethereum mainnet). Every
$1 of sales instantly unlocks $1 from each community Fund backing the project - match stacks across
funds. Runs in seasons (Curate -> Compete). On top sits an ART token + Endowment (~$14M, June 2026)
that funds the whole thing. Full deep-dive: [research/844](research/844-artizen-platform-deep-study/),
[research/845](research/845-artizen-art-token-endowment-economics/).

## The ZAO position (the strategy)

The ZAO already runs the **ZAO Fund for Emerging Culture** (Season 6, ~$22k raised, 32 projects).
The plan from here:

1. **Manage two funds** - keep Emerging Culture (broad) + create a dedicated **ZAO Festivals Fund**
   (music + artist-led IRL events). The festival lane is open white space: Greenpill owns regen
   gatherings, Terminus owns network states, Hubs owns permanent spaces - nobody owns music festivals.
2. **Run the whole portfolio as creators** - WaveWarZ, SongJam, ZAOstock, Thy Revolution, the ZABAL
   Games cohort each submit as projects.
3. **Stack** - cross-curate each project into multiple funds (proven: Edge Esmeralda is in both the
   Greenpill fund and the ZAO fund right now). ZAOstock -> ZAO Festivals + Greenpill + Emerging Culture.
4. **Show up** - Console (the social layer), Artizen LIVE (weekly show), DWeb Camp Village (Berlin,
   Jul 8-12), and the René/Owocki relationship.

## Run + deploy the site

ZArtizen is a standalone Next.js 16 app (the homepage is the ZAO Fund hub). To run it:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build (verified green)
```

To deploy + share with the Artizen community:
- Connect `ZAODEVZ/zartizen` to Vercel (Import Project) - it auto-builds on every push, no config needed.
- Or from the repo: `npx vercel --prod` (requires a Vercel login).

The homepage rotates a featured "Project of the day" automatically (server-side, by date), lists the
full fund roster, shows the like-minded funds, and has a "join the fund" submit path.

## Status (2026-06-13)

- Research: complete (8 docs).
- zaoos.com/artizen hub page: shipped in ZAOOS (PR #844).
- Kit: drafted, ready to use.
- ZAO Festivals Fund: proposal ready; NOT yet submitted (needs the René call).
- Daily spotlight series: drafted, not yet posting.

## Next steps

See [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md). Top three:
1. Send the René + Nate DM (`kit/outreach-drafts.md`) - book the call, ask the 3 open questions.
2. Start the daily spotlight series (`kit/daily-spotlights.md`).
3. Submit the ZAO Festivals Fund proposal (`kit/fund-proposal.md`) after the call.

## Open questions (need René)

1. Can one org run two funds? 2. Can a director curate their own project into their own fund?
3. Does a second fund get its own $50K seed?
