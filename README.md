# ZArtizen

The ZAO's home for everything Artizen: how The ZAO operates inside the Artizen ecosystem as a
fund manager, a creator, and a community - plus the research, the playbooks, and the ready-to-use
kit to execute.

Graduated out of the ZAOOS monorepo (2026-06-13) into its own repo under ZADEVZ so the work stops
colliding with parallel sessions and stands on its own. Research provenance still lives in ZAOOS
(PR #844); this repo is the operating home.

## What Artizen is (60 seconds)

Web3 match-funding platform for art / science / tech / culture, founded by René Pinnell. Creators
mint $10 open-edition "Artifact" NFTs (100% to creator, 0% platform fee, Ethereum mainnet). Every
$1 of sales instantly unlocks $1 from each community Fund backing the project - match stacks across
funds. Runs in seasons (Curate -> Compete). On top sits an ART token + a self-reported "$14M endowment"
- but on-chain that token's Juicebox project holds ~34 ETH and is dormant, so treat the $14M as
unverified (see [research/art-token-onchain.md](research/art-token-onchain.md)). Full deep-dive:
[research/844](research/844-artizen-platform-deep-study/), [research/845](research/845-artizen-art-token-endowment-economics/).

## The ZAO position (the strategy - updated 2026-06-14)

The ZAO already runs the **ZAO Fund for Emerging Culture** (Season 6). A full scan (79 funds) changed
the plan - the proposal is now under team review ([/proposal](app/proposal/page.tsx)):

1. **Curate into existing funds, don't rush to build a second one.** The "music white space" is gone -
   We're Loud Fund (DIY music festivals), Global Music Fund, and Greenpill already fund music events,
   and **six ZAO music projects are already stacked in the Global Music Fund**. So stack ZAOstock +
   Zaoville into We're Loud + Global Music + Greenpill + ZAO Emerging Culture rather than create an 80th fund.
2. **Run the whole portfolio as creators** - WaveWarZ, SongJam, ZAOstock, Zaoville, Thy Revolution, the
   ZABAL Games cohort each submit as projects.
3. **Stack across funds** - each project curates into 3-5 funds (see the stacking map in
   [research/fund-directory.md](research/fund-directory.md)). Put ZOE/Hermes in the **Bonfires Fund**
   (our knowledge-graph partner - Arun's DreamStarter + Abraham Nash are already there).
4. **Activate the existing ZAO fund** - it is dormant this drive (~#23, ~$188); the real bottleneck is
   getting people to collect its projects, not adding funds.
5. **Show up** - Console (the social layer), Artizen LIVE, DWeb Camp Village (Berlin, Jul 8-12), and the
   René / Bonfires / Edge City relationships.
6. **A dedicated ZAO Festivals Fund is a later, bigger step** - only if ZAO wants to host other
   organizers under it. Pending team input via [/proposal].

## Live site pages

The app (Next.js, live at **https://zaoartizen.vercel.app**) ships these pages:

| Route | What |
|---|---|
| `/` (`app/page.tsx`) | The ZAO Fund hub - daily featured project, searchable roster, like-minded funds, join path |
| `/dashboard` (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`) | **Live ZAO Fund scoreboard** - rank, match deployed/remaining, backed projects, cross-back targets, proof log. Data in `app/dashboard/data.ts`; refresh with `scripts/refresh.sh` |
| `/leaderboard` (`app/leaderboard/page.tsx`) | Season 6 field snapshot (all 35 projects), ZAO ties flagged |
| `/rally` (`app/rally/page.tsx`) | **GC-shareable 3-step crew CTA** - sign up, buy the $10 Artifact, boost |
| `/apply` (`app/apply/page.tsx`) | **Artist-facing** - what the fund backs, eligibility, how to get in. Send to applicants |
| `/festivals` (`app/festivals/page.tsx`) | The ZAO Festivals umbrella - events (ZAOstock, Zaoville), where it fits, how to join |
| `/proposal` (`app/proposal/page.tsx`) | Shareable decision page - create a fund vs curate into existing |

## Run + deploy the site

ZArtizen is a standalone Next.js 16 app (the homepage is the ZAO Fund hub). To run it:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build (verified green)
```

To deploy + share with the Artizen community:
- Connect `ZAODEVZ/ZAOartizen` to Vercel (Import Project) - it auto-builds on every push, no config needed.
- Or from the repo: `npx vercel --prod` (requires a Vercel login).

The homepage rotates a featured "Project of the day" automatically (server-side, by date), lists the
full fund roster, shows the like-minded funds, and has a "join the fund" submit path.

## Status (2026-06-14)

- Research: complete + audited (15 docs incl. full 79-fund directory + on-chain checks).
- Site: live (`/`, `/festivals`, `/proposal`) at zaoartizen.vercel.app.
- Kit: drafted, ready to use.
- Strategy: pivoted to **curate-into existing funds** (proposal under team review at `/proposal`).
- ZAO Fund: dormant this drive - needs its projects activated.

## Next steps

1. **Get team input on the proposal** - share `/proposal` (zaoartizen.vercel.app/proposal) with ZAO Festivals teammates.
2. **Activate the ZAO fund this drive** - rally the community to collect its projects (`kit/outreach-drafts.md` #4).
3. **Stack the events** - submit ZAOstock + Zaoville (`kit/make-festivals-on-artizen.md`) into We're Loud + Global Music + Greenpill + ZAO Emerging Culture.
4. **Put ZOE/Hermes in the Bonfires fund** (warm partner).
5. **Send the René DM** (`kit/outreach-drafts.md` #1) - only pursue a dedicated Festivals Fund if the team wants to host other organizers.

## Open questions

- Team: Option A (create a fund) or Option B (curate into existing)? Weigh in at `/proposal`.
- We're Loud Fund roster + curator contact (slug unresolved).
- Verify the $14M endowment: render Juicebox project 587's full treasury (the ART token points there; it shows ~34 ETH on-chain).
