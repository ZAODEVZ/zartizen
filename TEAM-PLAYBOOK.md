# ZAO x Artizen - Team Playbook

The front door for anyone helping with the ZAO's Artizen effort. Read this first, then go to the kit
(`kit/`) for copy-paste tools and `research/` for the deep dives.

Updated 2026-06-21.

## The mission

The ZAO runs the **ZAO Fund for Emerging Culture** on Artizen. Our job: back emerging artists, rally our
community to fund them, and prove the ZAO bootstraps creative communities better than anyone. We win by
moving a crowd, not by writing big checks.

## How Artizen works (90 seconds)

Artizen is match-funding for art, music, science, and culture (founder Rene Pinnell). Four roles - do not
mix them up:

- **Creator** - the artist. Mints $10 collectibles ("Artifacts"). 0% fees, 100% to them.
- **Project** - the work being funded. Gets curated into Funds. Can be in many Funds at once.
- **Curator** - picks Projects into a Fund based on taste. Does NOT supply the money - the Fund does.
- **Fund** - the money pool. Sponsors deposit; it unlocks as curated Projects sell Artifacts.

The money: every $1 a fan spends on an Artifact unlocks $1 from EACH Fund backing that Project (it stacks
across Funds). Of a Fund's capital, 90% is match, 10% is an end-of-season cash prize for its top Project.

**How you WIN (confirmed from the official playbook, play.artizen.fund):** rank = **Boost Score = (sales +
match unlocked) x boost points received / 100**. It is MULTIPLICATIVE - boosts multiply your dollars, so you
need BOTH. The playbook's own example: a project that sold the most dollars finished LAST because it had
almost no boosts; a project with fewer dollars but a boost-rich crowd took #1. So rally your people to do
TWO free-or-cheap things: **buy $10 Artifacts AND cast Boosts** (boosting is free). Boost points come from
holding ART, donating to the Endowment, completing your profile, and attending events. (This corrects the
earlier "most sales wins" framing - see ZAOOS research doc 887.)

**Winning Artifact spec:** square 1:1 (min 1000x1000), video/GIF performs best, NO text or graphic overlay.

## Our strategy: permissionless-first, then Rene

Do everything we can without anyone's approval first. Build a track record of bootstrapping communities
well. THEN bring that proof to Rene from a position of strength - do not ask for the accelerator or curator
intros up front, earn the conversation.

### Phase 1 - permissionless (now)

1. **Mobilize the crew.** Get ZAO members signed up on Artizen + Console. Rally coordinated $10 buys + boosts,
   timed to high-multiplier drives (2x / 3x weeks).
2. **Bring artists in.** Run the Discord curation vote and curate our people into the ZAO Fund: Marie Chain,
   COC Concertz, PolyRaiders, WaveWarZ Zambia. Help each mint a winning Artifact (square, video, no text).
   Submit each to every other fitting Fund too (We're Loud, Global Music, Greenpill) so match stacks.
3. **Run the bootstrap motion.** Each drive, pick ONE project to push for the prize (most Artifacts sold).
   Aim the whole crew at it. Climb the leaderboard. Document it.
4. **Build the proof.** Track what Rene actually cares about (below).

### The proof metrics that matter

The engine rewards distribution, not deposits. So we measure:

- **Match DEPLOYED** by the ZAO Fund (not just deposited) - the true KPI of a good fund.
- **Distinct Artifact buyers** mobilized from our community.
- **Projects curated + how they climbed** (sales, leaderboard rank).
- **Signups** driven onto Artizen / Console.
- A **repeatable** motion shown across more than one drive.

### Phase 2 - then Rene (after proof)

Approach Rene / Nate + the Accelerator for Community Funds with the track record: "we bootstrap communities
really well - here is the match we deployed and the crowd we moved." That earns the accelerator seat and the
curator-network intros (Sundance / SXSW / Tribeca / Venice programmers, 36 Cinema).

## Who does what

- **Fund manager (Zaal):** curation calls, rallies the crew, picks the horse each drive, owns the proof recap.
- **Crew / members:** sign up, buy $10 Artifacts of the pushed project, boost, reshare. This is the whole game.
- **Artists (Marie, COC, PolyRaiders, Zambia):** mint a strong Artifact, bring their own fans, post + engage.

## Cadence

See `kit/operating-rhythm.md` - daily (one spotlight + one boost), weekly (rally to the drive close +
cross-back 2-3 projects), per season (curate the cohort, then drive sales, then document).

## Where everything is

- `kit/` - copy-paste tools: outreach drafts, submission template, daily spotlights, artifact briefs,
  launch posts, sponsor one-pager, Rene call brief, operating rhythm. New this round:
  - `kit/new-artist-briefs.md` - submission briefs for Marie Chain, COC Concertz, PolyRaiders, WaveWarZ Zambia.
  - `kit/crew-mobilization.md` - the GC-ready "sign up, buy, boost" rally + how to run one.
  - `kit/standings-tracker.md` - the ZAO Fund scoreboard to update each drive (the proof we bring to Rene).
- `scripts/refresh.sh` - one command to re-scrape the live ZAO Fund numbers, update the dashboard, and redeploy
  (`bash scripts/refresh.sh`). Keeps `/dashboard` current without hand-editing. `scripts/refresh-fund.mjs --write`
  does just the scrape+update if you want to review before deploying.
- Live site: **https://zaoartizen.vercel.app** - `/dashboard` (scoreboard), `/leaderboard` (the field),
  `/rally` (the GC-shareable 3-step crew CTA).
- `research/` - the deep dives: platform study (844), ART/endowment economics (845), funding strategy (846),
  ecosystem playbook (847), fund-creation playbook (850), fund directory + stacking map (fund-directory.md),
  Rene digest, on-chain token reality check (art-token-onchain.md).

## One caution

Keep the ZAO treasury OFF the ART token. Ride the funding rail; the token/endowment layer is a reflexive
bonding curve (Rene's own words) and the self-reported "$14M endowment" is thin on-chain. See
`research/art-token-onchain.md`.
